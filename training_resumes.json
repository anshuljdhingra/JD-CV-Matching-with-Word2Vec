In which Provider has to pay or compensate for loss of their important services.\n\nB.T ECH Project (2009-2010):                                           \t\tSupervisor: Jeswinder Singh, NIIT Ludhiana\nTitle: MyTalk Chat server\t\n The MyTalk Chat server is prepared in Core Java through which can many clients can connect to server and broad\ncast their messages to all. The chat server uses the concept networking using Port numbers, ServerSocket/Socket\nclasses, Threads, File I/O Streams and Exception Handling. MyTalk provides the graphical interface using the swing\npackages and event handlers.\n\nPUBLICATIONS:\n\n· Rakesh Sachdeva, Mrs.Prabpreet Kaur “SSM: Secure Storage Migration among Cloud Providers” , ‘The IJST’ Journal Volume 1I, Issue III, March, 2014, page 120-126.\n· Rakesh Sachdeva, Mrs.Prabpreet Kaur “Performance Gathering and Implementing Portability on Cloud Storage Data” , 4th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE On Software Solutions, E-Learning, Computer Sciences, Information & Communication Technology (SECICT– 2014) ,vol IV, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, , 14th – 15th june 2014.\n· Rakesh Sachdeva , Taranpreet Singh, Vimal dev “Image Description using Graphcut and GrabCut algorithm with NLP”, International Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (ICEECS), Nagpur ,20th April 2014, page 115-120.\n· Rakesh Sachdeva, Arpit Dhingra “CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY THREATS AND RESPONSES”,  DAV National Congress on Science & Technology, DAVIET, Jalandhar, May 30–31, 2013, page 1627-1636.\n\n\nTRAINING PROJECTS :\n\n· Live Projects on Search Engine Optimization using Web Crawler.\n· Live Project on Web application development using ASP.NET.\n· Live Project on application development using C++.\n\nTECHNICAL SKILLS:\n\nProgramming Languages:         Java, J2EE, Python, NLP, Machie Learning, SQL, Servlets, JSP.\nIDES/Lib:                                      Netbeans, Eclipse, Conda, Scilab ,Stanford corenlp, Sklearn , SQL, Visual Studio,  CloudSim.\nOther Technical Skills:              Search Engine Optimization,  CSS, HTML, JavaScript. \n\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING:\n\n· Complete Java (Core Java and J2EE) from NIIT Ludhiana .\n· Search Engine Optimization from JSR Solutions Pvt limited.

It brings deep analytic capabilities to any healthcare Payer or Provider legacy application.\n· Working on Predicting Rework and Scrubbing Healthcare Claims ML application using Python and Spark ML, This application predict the below\n· Predict the claim is accepted or rejected, for each claim, provide a prediction of whether or not it will be rejected upon submission. For this  use the below binary classification algorithms, with area under the ROC curve as our single-number evaluation metric:\n• Logistic Regression • Random Forests • Decision Trees • Gradient-boosted Trees\n· Predict rejection reason(s) (CARCs). For each claim, among the claims requiring rework, provide a prediction for the rejection reason codes called CARCs. This uses a binary classification for each implemented CARC, we use the area under the ROC curve as our primary performance metric. Use the below four different families of binary classification algorithms for each implemented CARC:\n• Logistic Regression • Random Forests • Decision Trees • Gradient-boosted Trees\n· Claim scrubber using ML automate the process of reworking the claim, either completely or partially. Suggest changes to the claim that would result in acceptance. For this we use a multi-class classification algorithm for each CARC trained on scrubber comments. For each CARC, we train a multi-class classifier that will predict the most relevant scrubber comment for a given claim that we predict will be flagged with that CARC. Use accuracy as our single-number performance metric and again use four different families of algorithms, but for multi-class classification. \n• Logistic Regression • Random Forests • Decision Trees • Neural Network, specifically a MultiLayer Perceptron Classifier\n· Worked on Medication Adherence Prediction application by using Python and Spark, This application predict Highly Adherent, Barely Adherent, Non-Adherent and Severely Non-Adherent patient (Adherence is calculated as a decimal value between 0 and 1) and  used accuracy as our single-number performance metric and used four different families of algorithms for multi-class classification.\n   •Logistic Regression • Random Forests • Decision Trees • Neural Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Duration: Sep 2014 – Jan 2017\nOrganization Name: IMS Health Analytics, Bangalore.  \nPosition: Big Data Architect, Data Science.\nJob responsibilities:\n\n· Designed and developed the data projection component to project Product, ATC levels, TRA, SRA, state, national granularity level for week, month, quarterly and yearly basis pharmaceutical sell-out (Pharmacy to Consumer) amount, by using sell-in (Manufacturer to Pharmacy) and partial sell-out (Pharmacy to Consumer) data.\n· Projection component developed using spark and scala, this component include mainly three algorithms 1.Count based, 2.
